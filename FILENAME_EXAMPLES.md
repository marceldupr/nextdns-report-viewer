# PDF Report Filename Examples

The PDF reports now use a descriptive filename format that includes device and time range information.

## Filename Format

```

```

Where:
- `device`: Device identifier or "all" for all devices
- `yy-mm-dd`: Year-month-day (e.g., 25-09-13 for September 13, 2025)
- `hh-mm`: Hours-minutes in 24-hour format

## Benefits

1. **Descriptive**: Immediately shows what's in the report
2. **Sortable**: Chronological sorting by date and time
3. **Device-Specific**: Clear indication of which devices are included
4. **Time-Bounded**: Exact time range for easy reference
5. **Consistent**: Same format across all reports

## Implementation Details

- Device names are sanitized (special characters â†’ hyphens)
- Times are in SAST format (matching the report content)
- Fallbacks handle edge cases (empty data, no time range)
- Format is validated with unit tests
